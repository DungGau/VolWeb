Volweb is a digital forensic memory analysis platform.  
The goal of VolWeb is to improve the efficiency of memory forensics by providing a centralized, visual and enhanced platform for incident responders and digital forensics investigators.  
VolWeb is based on volatility3, and this platform will evolve with the framework development.

**Volweb is still in development and will evolve quickly.**  
Update communications will be via twitter or by following this repo.

- process scan
- process dump
- process env
- process cmdline
- process privileges
- process dump
- network scan
- hashdump
- dlllist
- filescan
- Timeline Explorer
- malfind
- User Authentication
- User Management
- Automatic Report Generation


## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
Volweb is fully dockerized and can be deployed in a production environment.
In order to deploy Volweb, you should follow these steps:

Download the latest release: https://github.com/k1nd0ne/VolWeb/releases

Then, navigate to the VolWeb directory and edit the **./docker/volweb.env** file and add the secret information to the following fields:

```
 POSTGRES_USER=USER_HERE
 POSTGRES_PASSWORD=PASSWORD_HERE
 DJANGO_SECRET=SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

Next, add your ssl certificate into the **nginx/ssl** folder (generated via certbot or openssl for example):
```
openssl genrsa > ./VolWeb/docker/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem
openssl req -new -x509 -key ./VolWeb/docker/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem > ./VolWeb/docker/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem
```
**Don't forget to fill the different fields in the openssl certificate configuration.
Make sure that the privkey and fullchain files respectively have the same name as the example above.**

Finally, build the images and run the containers.
```
cd ./VolWeb/docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

The ngnix logs can be found in the **/ngnix/log** folder.

By default the admin account created will have the following credentials:

```
admin:password
```

Navigate to https://[VOLWEB HOSTED IP]/admin and create an analyst account in the "User" section.
Don't forget to had the first name and the last name of the analyst.  
Change the admin password.  
Disconnect from the admin panel and navigate to https://[VOLWEB HOSTED IP]/

## Reset

‚ö†Ô∏è This procedure will delete all the memory dumps, IOCs and database items and will reset the VolWeb platform ‚ö†Ô∏è

```
cd ./VolWeb/docker
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

```
cd ./VolWeb/
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete
```

## Important Note

The admin account cannot create analysis. Only use this account for analyst account creation and don't forget to change the password.
Create the analysts accounts via the Django administration panel -> https://[VOLWEB HOSTED IP]/admin.

## Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
If you have found an issue, please raise it.
I am performing one sprint every month to fix discovered bugs.
I am also performing whitebox pentests to improve the SecOps dimension.
